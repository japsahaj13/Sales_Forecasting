Enhancing Retail Operations with Advanced Sales Forecasting

Project Overview
We completed a groundbreaking project dedicated to enhancing retail operations for Corporación Favorita, a cherished grocery store chain in Ecuador. Our focus was on elevating sales forecasting to new heights using advanced machine learning techniques.

Methodology
Data Analysis
Our approach began by dissecting multivariate time-series data into key components: trend, seasons, cycles, and random error, forming an additive model crucial for accurate predictions.

Model Development
By integrating traditional statistical methods with cutting-edge techniques like linear regression and XGBoost, we achieved unprecedented accuracy in sales forecasting. Our standout model, a hybrid of Linear Regression and XGBoost, delivered exceptional results:
Validation RMSLE: 0.0150
Test RMSLE: 0.5158

Model Comparison
Our results set a new standard for forecasting precision in retail, outperforming other models tested:
LSTM: Validation RMSLE 0.75, Test RMSLE 0.6109
MLP Regression and XGBoost Hybrid: Validation RMSLE 0.0180, Test RMSLE 0.7568
Linear Regression: Validation RMSLE 0.5488, Test RMSLE 0.7568

Results and Achievements
Our findings demonstrate that integrating Linear Regression with XGBoost offers a superior approach to forecasting customer demand in retail settings.

Kaggle Competition
Our project was recognized in the ongoing Kaggle competition "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting," where we achieved an impressive rank of 225. This achievement highlights the competitiveness and robustness of our forecasting model on a global platform.

Real-World Validation
The real-world validation at a university café, Uncle Tonnies, verified the versatility and reliability of our methodology, yielding an RMSLE of 0.517. This real-world success solidifies our project's value, showcasing its potential to drive tangible results and bolster profitability for businesses like Corporación Favorita.
